## What is E-Khata?

Starting **October 1, 2024**, the **Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP)** has made **eKhata** a compulsory requirement for **property registration** and **title transfers**.
eKhata is the **digital version of the traditional Khata** and applies to both **A and B category properties**. It includes all the standard details present in a Khata Certificate and Extract, along with additional key information such as:

- Photograph of the property owner(s)  
- Photograph of the property  
- Geographical coordinates  
- Floor-wise area  
- Sale deed document number

Each eKhata document features a **barcode** that helps **verify authenticity** and **prevent fraudulent property transactions**.

If a **draft eKhata** for your property is already available, you can convert your Khata to eKhata via the official **BBMP eAasthi portal**:

![property list search result](./property_list_search_result.png)

Here, you will see all the details for your flat. Property ePID is unique indentifier for your property and is only available in the draft eKhata and is not information you would have beforehand. Owner name shows the current owner for the property as per the latest Khata. Here, I have already submitted my E-Khata and updated myself as the owner. Therefore, you can see owner name being **SOURAB MANGRULKAR**. In the **Download** tab I can download my E-Khata. The process for it is specified in section [How to Download the Approved E-Khata?](#how-to-download-the-approved-ekhata)

In this blogpost, I want to look at the case of previous owner or builder name being displayed as owner and how to submit E-Khata Application to get it corrected. Here, we assume that you have already done the Khata transfer process and possess the physical copy of Khata extract in your name. Below is an example where the owner is the builder (**Arvind Infracon LLP Rep By Mr. Deepak Manchanda**) of the property as the current owner.
![property list search result for builder as owner](./builder_as_owner.png). Here, click on the **Click Here** button in the column **Submit information for FINAL ekhata for correction in ekhata**. You will see the below page.
